IBM Innovate 2010: General RFT

IBM Innovate 2011: Hazelcast

IBM Innovate 2012: JythonLauncher

Below are notes regarding the particular demos


*****HAZELCAST NOTES*****
Please launch compiledHazelcastServer/normalMode.cmd on all your test machines before trying to run any demo scripts.

in order to run the work distribution demo please launch ScriptExecutionHandler on all but one of your test machines.

Launch DemoQueueLoader on the last machine in order to push the scripts into the work queue. 



*****JYTHONLAUNCHER NOTES*****
Projects are currently set up for RFT version 8.2.1.1 on a 32 bit machine.  

If you are using a newer or older version of RFT or a 64 bit system you will get PYTHONPATH errors

Also if your Jython interpreter is not setup PyDev will say that it cannot find the Interpreter.

To fix these errors follow the slides for configuring PyDev that is included in the Powerpoint folder for Innovate 2012.
