  Rational Functional Tester is a powerful tool but it is limited to use with Java or VB.NET. However, not all developers are familiar or even like the style of programming that comes with Java and VB.NET.  Using Jython, an implementation of Python, you can create a layer over the normal RFT methods and classes so that you can create your scripts using the Python programming language. Python is flexable and easy to learn, by having this language as an option for writing scripts it would allow a wider variety of people to write scripts even with limited knowledge of the classic tools available through RFT.
