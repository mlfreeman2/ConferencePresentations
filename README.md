# Conference Presentations

Conference Talk Materials

Code and slides from conferences I've spoken at, mostly IBM Innovate/InterConnect talks I gave and/or was involved with from 2010-on.
All slides were done with PowerPoint originally (Mac 2011/2016 mostly)

I would **NOT** copy this code blindly into something critical.
It was designed to be a teaching sample more than real world.
I knowingly removed lots of error handling I would normally have, in order to make it easier for people to read and understand the ideas I was sharing.
Also, this code will probably not be updated unless I use it in future Innovate talks.
The code for 2012 builds on the code for 2011, which builds on the code for 2010.

## 2017
### IBM Interconnect 2017
#### HDT-4470

*Automating Automation, Cheaply*

>My efforts to design and build a self-service automation lab and VM system on the cheap, heavily inspired by cloud providers.

>There's no code with this one.

## 2013
### IBM Innovate 2013
#### QM-1845

*Rational Quality Manager’s REST API: Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices*

>This download has the powerpoint slides and the code examples. 
The code examples are 90% Java & C#, with one Perl script.

>The Java examples were done on Java 6 in Eclipse and consist of two projects:
RQM_Common (a project containing code that should hopefully be reusable)
RQMExamples (a project containing the 3 Java examples – 2 console based and 1 Swing based)

>The core of the Java RQM code is the RQMSession class (RQM_Common\src\org\mlfreeman\innovate2013\network\http\rqm)

>The other code in the RQM_Common project is supporting code for RQMSession (but might be useful elsewhere too).

>The C# examples were done on .NET 4.0 in Visual Studio 2010.
>There are 5 examples  (Examples\ everything) in the Visual Studio solution and 1 common project (Shared\RQM.API).
>In the C# code, as in the Java code, RQMSession is the core class.

>The RQMSession classes in both Java and C# should be identical in capability.

## 2012
### IBM Innovate 2012 
#### QM-1213

*Rational Functional Tester scripting with Jython*

>I co-presented this talk, assisting Sean McAdams with his first presentation at Innovate.
The code for this talk is mixed in with the code for my talks from 2011 and 2010.

>See 2012/PowerPoint/QM-1213.ppt for the PowerPoint version of the slides.

## 2011
### IBM Innovate 2011 
#### QM-1284

*RFT Testing Clouds - Multi-Process, Multi-Machine Automation*

>See 2011/QM-1284.pdf for the PDF version of the slides.

## 2010
### IBM Innovate 2010
#### QM-1510A

*Reducing the cost of RFT script maintenance with advanced RFT script development and maintenance tips*

>The code is from my talk QM-1510A, and there are slides from the non-technical talk I co-presented (QM-1992A) in there as well.

>See 2010/Innovate2010_QM-1510A.pdf for the PDF version of the slides.
